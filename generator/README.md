## README for `model.py`

### Overview
The `model.py` file contains the implementation of a PyTorch Lightning module named `RetrievalAugmentedGenerator`, designed to generate tactics for theorem proving. This module integrates a T5 model for generating tactic predictions, potentially augmented with premises retrieved by a `PremiseRetriever`.

### Key Components

- **`TopkAccuracy` (Class):** A custom metric class for evaluating the top-k accuracy of model predictions.
- **`TacticGenerator` (Abstract Base Class):** Defines the interface for tactic generators, requiring implementations for `generate` and `batch_generate` methods.
- **`RetrievalAugmentedGenerator` (Class):** Inherits from `TacticGenerator` and `pytorch_lightning.LightningModule`, encapsulating the main functionality of the tactic generation model.

### Main Methods

- **`__init__`:** Initializes the model, setting up the T5 transformer, tokenizer, and optional premise retriever.
- **`forward`:** Defines the forward pass of the model, computing the loss directly from input and output tensors.
- **`training_step`:** Conducts a single step of model training, calculating loss and logging key information.
- **`validation_step`:** Similar to `training_step`, but also includes generation of tactics using beam search to evaluate the model during validation.
- **`generate` and `batch_generate`:** Methods for generating tactics based on input state; `generate` handles single instances, while `batch_generate` is designed for batch processing.

### Utilities

- **`_log_io_texts`:** Logs the input and output texts to TensorBoard for monitoring during training or validation phases.
- **`configure_optimizers`:** Sets up optimizers and learning rate schedules based on the model configuration.

### Usage
This module is typically used in a training script where instances of `RetrievalAugmentedGenerator` are created, trained on batches of theorem proving tasks, and evaluated on their ability to generate appropriate tactics.

### Files and Dependencies
- Relies on `common.py` for utility functions and `retrieval.model` for optional premise retrieval functionality.
- Utilizes libraries such as `torch`, `pytorch_lightning`, `transformers`, and `torchmetrics`.
