### Workflow

1. **Retrieve theorems from the specified data source:**
   - The `_get_theorems` function retrieves theorems based on the provided criteria, such as data path, split, file path, full name, name filter, and the number of theorems.
   - It calls `_get_theorems_from_files` to load theorems from JSON files and filters them based on the specified criteria.
   - The retrieved theorems are checked for availability in the cache using `is_available_in_cache`.

2. **Search for proofs using multiple concurrent provers:**
   - The `evaluate` function is the main evaluation function that orchestrates the proof search.
   - It creates a `DistributedProver` object with the specified configuration, including the checkpoint path, indexed corpus path, tactic, module, number of workers, number of GPUs, timeout, and number of sampled tactics.
   - The `search_unordered` method of the `DistributedProver` is called to search for proofs of the theorems using multiple concurrent provers.

3. **Calculate evaluation metrics:**
   - After the proof search is completed, the script calculates the result statistics, including the number of proved theorems, failed theorems, and discarded non-theorems.
   - The pass@1 metric is computed, representing the proportion of proved theorems among the total theorems (excluding discarded ones).

4. **Save evaluation results:**
   - The evaluation results are saved as a pickle file in the `./results` directory with a unique experiment ID.

### File Structure

- `evaluate.py`: The main evaluation script that orchestrates the proof search and calculates metrics.
- `proof_search.py`: Contains the implementation of the `DistributedProver` and the proof search algorithm.
- `search_tree.py`: Defines the data structures and methods for representing and manipulating the search tree during proof search.




## ðŸ‘¾ `search_tree.py`

The `search_tree.py` file contains the definitions of the search tree used by the prover. It defines the necessary classes and methods for representing and manipulating the search tree during the proof search process.

### Status Enum

The `Status` enum represents the status of a node or a proof search. It can have the following values:

- `PROVED`: The node or search has at least one known proof.
- `FAILED`: The node or search has exhausted its options and cannot be proved within the current run.
- `OPEN`: The node or search has not been proven or given up on yet.

### Node Abstract Base Class

The `Node` class is an abstract base class that defines the common properties and methods for all nodes in the search tree. It has the following abstract properties:

- `status`: The status of the node (`Status` enum).
- `distance_to_proof`: The smallest number of steps to a proof from the node.
- `is_terminal`: Indicates whether the node is a terminal node (i.e., a proof finished node or an error node).

### ProofFinishedNode

The `ProofFinishedNode` class represents a node that indicates a finished proof. It has the following properties:

- `inner`: The `ProofFinished` object representing the finished proof.
- `status`: Always set to `Status.PROVED`.
- `distance_to_proof`: Always set to 0.
- `is_terminal`: Always set to `True`.

### ErrorNode

The `ErrorNode` class represents a node that indicates an error during the proof search. It has the following properties:

- `inner`: The error object (`LeanError`, `TimeoutError`, or `ProofGivenUp`).
- `status`: Always set to `Status.FAILED`.
- `distance_to_proof`: Always set to infinity.
- `is_terminal`: Always set to `True`.

### InternalNode

The `InternalNode` class represents an internal node in the search tree, representing a nonterminal state. It has the following properties and methods:

- `state`: The `TacticState` object representing the goal state of the node.
- `cumulative_logprob`: The sum of action log probabilities along the edges from the root to the node.
- `in_edges`: A list of `Edge` objects representing the edges leading to the node.
- `out_edges`: A list of `Edge` objects representing the edges leading out of the node. When a node is explored, this list is populated and must not change after that.
- `is_terminal`: Always set to `False`.
- `status`: The status of the node, computed based on the status of its children.
- `distance_to_proof`: The number of steps separating the node from the end of a proof along the optimal path. Updated as needed by children.
- `is_explored`: Indicates whether the node has been explored (i.e., its outgoing edges have been generated).
- `priority`: The priority of the node, used for sorting in the best-first search. Nodes are compared by inverse priority, so a node with higher priority has a lower value.
- `extract_proof`: Extracts a proof of the node as a sequence of edges if the node is proved.
- `check_invariants`: Performs sanity checks on the node and its properties.

### Edge

The `Edge` class represents an edge in the search tree, representing a tactic. It has the following properties:

- `tactic`: The tactic string associated with the edge.
- `src`: The source `InternalNode` of the edge.
- `dst`: The destination `Node` of the edge.
- `distance_to_proof`: The distance to a proof from the edge, computed as 1 plus the distance to proof of the destination node.

### Best-First Search

The `search_tree.py` file provides the necessary data structures and methods for performing best-first search in the proof search process. The `InternalNode` class represents the nodes in the search tree, and the `Edge` class represents the edges connecting the nodes.

During the best-first search, the prover maintains a priority queue of `InternalNode` objects. The priority of a node is determined by its `cumulative_logprob`, which is the sum of the action log probabilities along the edges from the root to the node. The nodes with higher `cumulative_logprob` are considered to have higher priority and are explored first.

The search starts from the root node and expands the nodes in the priority queue based on their priority. When a node is expanded, its outgoing edges are generated using the tactic generator. The destination nodes of the edges are added to the priority queue if they are not terminal nodes (i.e., not `ProofFinishedNode` or `ErrorNode`).

The search continues until a proof is found (`ProofFinishedNode` is reached), the search space is exhausted (no more nodes to explore), or a timeout occurs. The `extract_proof` method can be used to extract the sequence of edges that form a proof if the search is successful.

The `status` and `distance_to_proof` properties of the nodes are updated recursively based on the status and distances of their children. This allows the prover to efficiently determine the status of the search and the optimal path to a proof.

The `check_invariants` method is used for debugging purposes to perform sanity checks on the nodes and ensure the integrity of the search tree.

### Classes

#### `SearchResult`

The `SearchResult` class is a dataclass that represents the result of attempting to prove a theorem. It contains the following fields:
- `theorem`: The theorem being proved.
- `status`: The status of the proof search (proved, failed, or open).
- `proof`: The proof steps if the theorem is proved, otherwise `None`.
- `actor_time`: The time spent by the actor (prover) during the proof search.
- `environment_time`: The time spent by the environment (theorem prover) during the proof search.
- `total_time`: The total time taken for the proof search.
- `num_total_nodes`: The total number of nodes explored during the search.
- `num_searched_nodes`: The number of nodes actually searched (expanded) during the search.

#### `BestFirstSearchProver`

The `BestFirstSearchProver` class is the main prover class that uses best-first search to find proofs. It has the following methods:

- `__init__(self, tac_gen, timeout, num_sampled_tactics, debug)`: Initializes the prover with the given tactic generator, timeout, number of sampled tactics, and debug flag.
- `search(self, repo, thm, pos)`: Performs the proof search for the given theorem `thm` from the repository `repo` at position `pos`. Returns a `SearchResult` object.
- `_best_first_search(self)`: Performs the best-first search algorithm until a proof is found, the search space is exhausted, a timeout occurs, or the search fails.
- `_step(self)`: Performs a single step of the search by selecting the node with the highest priority, generating tactic suggestions, and expanding the node with the generated tactics.
- `_generate_tactics(self, ts)`: Generates tactic suggestions for the given tactic state `ts` using the tactic generator.
- `_run_tactic(self, node, tactic, logprob)`: Runs the given `tactic` on the `node` with the corresponding `logprob`. Returns the resulting edge and a boolean indicating if the proof is finished.
- `check_invariants(self)`: Performs sanity checks on the search tree and priority queue (for debugging purposes).

#### `CpuProver`

The `CpuProver` class is a Ray actor that runs an instance of `BestFirstSearchProver` on a CPU. It inherits from `BestFirstSearchProver` and initializes the prover with the given parameters.

#### `GpuProver`

The `GpuProver` class is a Ray actor that runs an instance of `BestFirstSearchProver` on a GPU. It inherits from `BestFirstSearchProver` and initializes the prover with the given parameters.

#### `DistributedProver`

The `DistributedProver` class is a wrapper around `CpuProver` and `GpuProver` that handles the distribution of proof search tasks across multiple workers. It has the following methods:

- `__init__(self, ckpt_path, indexed_corpus_path, tactic, module, num_workers, num_gpus, timeout, num_sampled_tactics, debug)`: Initializes the distributed prover with the given parameters and sets up the worker actors (`CpuProver` or `GpuProver`) based on the specified configuration.
- `search_unordered(self, repo, theorems, positions)`: Performs parallel proof search for the given `theorems` from the repository `repo` at the corresponding `positions`. Returns a list of `SearchResult` objects. The order of the results is not guaranteed to match the order of the input.


## Usage

To use the bi-level goal-driven best-first search for theorem proving, you can create an instance of the `DistributedProver` class with the desired parameters and call the `search_unordered` method with the repository, theorems, and positions. The prover will distribute the proof search tasks across the specified number of workers (`num_workers`) and utilize the available GPUs (`num_gpus`) if specified.

The `DistributedProver` will return a list of `SearchResult` objects, each containing the result of attempting to prove a theorem, including the proof steps if the theorem is proved, the status of the proof search, and various statistics such as the time taken and the number of nodes explored.

Note: The `DistributedProver` uses the Ray library for distributed computing. Make sure to have Ray installed and initialized properly before using the distributed prover.

## Debugging

The `BestFirstSearchProver` class includes a `check_invariants` method that performs sanity checks on the search tree and priority queue. These checks are useful for debugging purposes and can be enabled by setting the `debug` flag to `True` when initializing the prover.


Make sure to have these dependencies installed before running the code.
